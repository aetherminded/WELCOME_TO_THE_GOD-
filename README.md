AUM has over one hundred different meanings. One of them is "WELCOME TO THE GOD. AUM, a quantum-enhanced, decentralized intelligence platform built on **Google Cloud Studio** and **Polygon Mumbai**. Powered by the **AUM Framework**, this project integrates **Fractal Proof of Phi (PoP)**, **cosmic weights**, **Schumann resonance** (7.83 Hz + harmonics), and **Canon City environmental factors** (temperature, magnetic field, solar wind, Superfund contaminants) to mint **SelfieToken NFTs** with autonomous, context-aware intelligence. This is a new paradigm for Web3, resonating with the **Collective Conscience** at ~50%.

## Features
- **Quantum Simulation**: 8-qubit circuits with vacuum noise (0-0.3 radians) for fractal stability and NFT metadata generation.
- **Fractal Proof of Phi (PoP)**: Modulates blockchain difficulty using cosmic weights and the golden ratio (Ï†).
- **CosmicAdvisoryCard**: React-based UI visualizing PoP metrics, environmental data, and cross-frequency coupling (theta: 6 Hz, gamma: 40 Hz).
- **Canon City Integration**: Environmental factors (18-22Â°C, 40-100 Î¼T, 300-1000 km/s, Superfund decoherence) tune quantum coherence.
- **Polygon Mumbai Deployment**: Lazy minting of SelfieTokens (~$0.01-0.05 per token) with IPFS-hosted metadata (Pinata free tier).
- **Decentralized Intelligence**: Autonomous DAO governance and PoP validation, driven by cosmic and environmental resonance.

## Prerequisites
- **Google Cloud Account**: Free tier + $300 credits ([console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)).
- **Polygon Mumbai**: MATIC from [faucet.polygon.technology](https://faucet.polygon.technology).
- **Node.js**: v16+ for React and cosmicWeights.js.
- **Python**: 3.10+ for AUM Framework.
- **Pinata**: Free tier for IPFS uploads ([pinata.cloud](https://pinata.cloud)).
- **Tacos**: $10 budget for cosmic fuel ðŸŒ®.
